Thank you for your valuable review and feedback. I have revised the report in accordance with your recommendations and have now completed the full report. However, I would like to clarify a few points where strict adherence to the guidelines has resulted in certain outcomes that may differ from expectations. These are explained below:

The report follows the specified formatting guidelines: Times New Roman font, size 12, double line spacing (2.0), and 1-inch (2.5 cm) margins on all sides.
I have removed your designation from the title page, as advised.
The pagination has been adjusted so that Page 1 begins from "Chapter 1 – Introduction."
All chapters and subchapters start on a new page to ensure clarity and structure.
The total word count of the report is approximately 27,000 words, which is well within the prescribed range of 15,000 to 30,000 words.
While the report exceeds 100 pages, it is due to the mandated double-spacing format (gap between 2 lines is 2.0). The guidelines do not specify a maximum page limit, only a word count range and a maximum file size.
The final PDF file size is 1.8 MB, which complies with the requirement of staying under 2 MB.
I have included 24 images and figures, and a corresponding list of figures has also been provided for reference.
I am also preparing a live dashboard, which will be demonstrated during the viva presentation.
